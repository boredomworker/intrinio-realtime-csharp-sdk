# Intrinio C# SDK for Real-Time Stock, and Forex Prices

[Intrinio](https://intrinio.com/) provides real-time stock and forex prices via a two-way WebSocket connection. To get started, [subscribe to a real-time data feed](https://intrinio.com/marketplace/data/prices/realtime) and follow the instructions below.

## Requirements

- .NET 4.0

## Features

* Receive streaming, real-time price quotes (last trade, bid, ask)
* Subscribe to updates from individual securities or forex pairs
* Subscribe to updates for all securities or forex pairs

### Installation

Use NuGet to include the client DLL in your project.

```
Install-Package IntrinioRealTimeClient
```

Alternatively, you can download the required DLLs from the [Releases page](https://github.com/intrinio/intrinio-realtime-csharp-sdk/releases).

## Example Usage
```csharp
using System;
using Intrinio;

namespace MyNamespace
{
    class MyProgram
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string api_key = "YOUR_INTRINIO_API_KEY";
            QuoteProvider provider = QuoteProvider.IEX;

            using (RealTimeClient client = new RealTimeClient(provider, api_key: api_key))
            {
                QuoteHandler handler = new QuoteHandler();
                handler.OnQuote += (IQuote quote) =>
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(quote);
                };

                client.RegisterQuoteHandler(handler);
                client.Join(new string[] { "MSFT", "AAPL", "AMZN" });
                client.Connect();

                Console.ReadLine();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Handling Quotes and the Queue

When the Intrinio Realtime library receives quotes from the WebSocket connection, it places them in an internal queue.Once a quote has been placed in the queue, a registered `QuoteHandler` will receive it emit an `OnQuote` event. Make sure to handle the `OnQuote` event quickly, so that the queue does not grow over time and your handler falls behind. We recommend registering multiple `QuoteHandler` instances for operations such as writing quotes to a database (or anything else involving time-consuming I/O). The client also has a `QueueSize()` method, which returns an integer specifying the approximate length of the quote queue. Monitor this to make sure you are processing quotes quickly enough.

## Providers

Currently, Intrinio offers real-time data for this SDK from the following providers:

* IEX - [Homepage](https://iextrading.com/)
* QUODD [Homepage](http://home.quodd.com/)
* FXCM - [Homepage](https://www.fxcm.com/)

Each has distinct price channels and quote formats, but a very similar API.

## Quote Data Format

Each data provider has a different format for their quote data.

### QUODD

NOTE: Messages from QUOOD reflect _changes_ in market data. Not all fields will be present in every message. Upon subscribing to a channel, you will receive one quote and one trade message containing all fields of the latest data available.

## Channels

### QUODD

To receive price quotes from QUODD, you need to instruct the client to "join" a channel. A channel can be
* A security ticker with data feed designation (`AAPL.NB`, `MSFT.NB`, `GE.NB`, etc)

### IEX

To receive price quotes from IEX, you need to instruct the client to "join" a channel. A channel can be
* A security ticker (`AAPL`, `MSFT`, `GE`, etc)
* The security lobby (`$lobby`) where all price quotes for all securities are posted
* The security last price lobby (`$lobby_last_price`) where only last price quotes for all securities are posted

Special access is required for both lobby channels. [Contact us](mailto:sales@intrinio.com) for more information.

### FXCM

To receive price quotes from FXCM, you need to instruct the client to "join" a channel. A channel can be

* `fxcm:pair:{pair_code}` - the fx currency pair channel where price updates for the provided currency pair are posted (i.e. `fxcm:pair:EUR/USD`)
* `fxcm:base:{currency_code}` - the fx currency channel where prices updates for any fx currency pair that has the provided currency as the base currency (i.e. `fxcm:base:EUR` would post prices from EUR/USD, EUR/JPY, etc.)
* `fxcm:quote:{currency_code}` - the fx currency channel where prices updates for any fx currency pair that has the provided currency as the quote currency (i.e. `fxcm:quote:USD` would post prices from EUR/USD, JPY/USD, etc.)

The Intrinio REST API provides a listing of pairs, currencies, and their corresponding codes:

* [FX Currencies](https://docs.intrinio.com/documentation/download/currencies)
* [FX Currency Pairs](https://docs.intrinio.com/documentation/download/currency_pairs)

## API Keys

You will receive your Intrinio API Key after [creating an account](https://intrinio.com/signup). You will need a subscription to a [realtime data feed](https://intrinio.com/marketplace/data/prices/realtime) as well.

## Logging

If you are experiencing issues, we recommend attaching a logger to the client, which will show you detailed debugging information. Add the following sections to your `app.config`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <configSections>
    <section name="log4net" type="log4net.Config.Log4NetConfigurationSectionHandler, log4net"/>
  </configSections>
  <log4net>
    <appender name="ConsoleAppender" type="log4net.Appender.ColoredConsoleAppender">
      <layout type="log4net.Layout.PatternLayout">
        <conversionPattern value="%date %level [%thread] %logger{1} %username - %message%newline"/>
      </layout>
      <mapping>
        <level value="WARN"/>
        <foreColor value="Yellow, HighIntensity"/>
      </mapping>
      <mapping>
        <level value="ERROR"/>
        <foreColor value="Red, HighIntensity"/>
      </mapping>
    </appender>
    <root>
      <level value="DEBUG"/>
      <appender-ref ref="ConsoleAppender"/>
    </root>
  </log4net>
</configuration>
```
